Defintion of Swifter : German Inventor Karl von Drais is credited with developing the first bicycle. 
His machine, known as the "swiftwalker," hit the road in 1817. In this case, "Swifter" means a fast and quick bicycle transportation.
My initial goal for this project was to use bicycle robots in real-world applications, particularly in logistics and delivery
